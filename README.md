## Problem Statement:

The Customer Contact Analysis project aims to analyze and derive insights from a dataset of customer interactions. It focuses on understanding the nature of customer contacts, agent performance, and customer feedback. The goal is to improve customer service and enhance the overall customer experience.

## About the Dataset:

The dataset contains the following columns:
S.No: A serial number for each entry.
Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Order ID: Unique order identifier.
Customer Name: Name of the customer.
Contact Date: Date when the customer was contacted.
Contact Type: The purpose of the contact (e.g., Query, Request, Complaint).
Is It for an Order?: Indicates whether the contact is related to an order (Yes/No).
Ticket ID: Identifier for the customer service ticket.
Agent Handled: Name of the agent who handled the customer contact.
Rating Given: The rating given by the customer (in percentage).

## Key Objectives:

 The main objectives of the Customer Contact Analysis project are as follows:
1. Contact Type Analysis: Analyze the distribution of contact types to understand the primary reasons customers contact support.
2. Agent Performance: Evaluate the performance of agents based on their handling of customer contacts and customer ratings.
3. Order-Related Contacts: Examine the percentage of contacts related to orders and identify any recurring issues.
4. Customer Feedback: Explore customer ratings and feedback to assess overall satisfaction.

## Data Processing:

Data Import: Import the dataset into Microsoft Excel.

Data Cleaning: Clean the data by addressing missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.

Data Transformation: Create calculated columns if necessary, such as converting the "Rating Given" column to a numerical format.

Data Analysis: Perform data analysis using Excel's functions and tools to achieve the project objectives. For example, use pivot tables to analyze contact types, agent performance, and order-related contacts.

Data Visualization: Create charts, graphs, and tables to visualize the findings and insights. For instance, use bar charts to display the distribution of contact types and agent performance.

## Insights
1.Contact Type Analysis: Requests were the most common contact type, accounting for 53% of customer interactions, followed by Queries (38%) and Complaints (9%). This indicates that a significant portion of customer contacts is related to specific requests, making it an essential area for attention and improvement.

2. Customer Visits: The data shows that daily customer visits remained consistent with no unusual fluctuations. This stability suggests that there are no significant variations in the frequency of customer contacts over the analyzed period.

3. Agent Roch Cousineau: Roch Cousineau had the highest number of customer interactions among all agents. This indicates that Roch plays a crucial role in customer service and may require further analysis to understand the reasons behind the high interaction volume and to potentially optimize workload distribution among agents.
